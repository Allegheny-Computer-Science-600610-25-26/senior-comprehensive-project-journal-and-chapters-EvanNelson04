I think this class has been organized in a very beneficial way for me and hopefully my colleagues if they feel the same way. All the work
that I have completed up to this point has really been helped and driven through this class.

One major point that I really enjoyed was the presenation pitch. I think about halfway through the semester we all presented to our professors
and colleagues what we were developing. This provided us the ability to recieve questions from colleagues and professors which made sure 
that I knew to a full extent what I was creating and had the ability to put this on display in front of my peers. The feedback that I recieved
made me certain that I was on the right track for my comp and what I was developing. I recieved lots of good praises from my professors
about what I was creating along with ideas and crticism that I was able to implement into my application. Without this presentation, I dont 
think that I would have advanced my "elevator pitch" skills to be able to talk about my senior comprehensive project to anyone that is 
curious about it. This was by far my favorite part of this class even though it was slightly nerve-racking.

Another thing that I really enjoyed was all the peer reviews about our writing and computational artifact. Getting this outside feedback from
colleagues that aren't always getting constant updates about my project is very important. Making sure that from my first chapter they can understand
what my project is and what it aims to solve is important to me. I want anyone to read my paper and understand the problem and solution that
I am working with each day. I was able to gain feedback from my first reader and advisor, along with feedback from my colleagues Benedek and
Logan. This provided me with things I didn't see in my paper which helped me sound more professional and change certain things for the
better.

In conclusion I really have no bad feedback about the way this course was designed. I think it is tailored in a way that really focuses on us
as the students to help us in our journey throughout this year. I personally wouldn't change anything or add anything within the class as I
really have enjoyed everything we have completed.
