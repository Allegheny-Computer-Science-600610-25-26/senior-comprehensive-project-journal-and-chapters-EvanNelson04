My presenation went very well in my opinion. Most of the preperation and research for the presenation came naturally
as it was basically documenting the process of what I was developing. 

In preperation for the presenation I picked out the most important themes for me to nail down. Some of these included, 
pain points, problem and solution of my project, and why does my project matter. Emphasizing the importance of 
starting my presenatation with an emphasis on talking to the listeners to make sure that they understand my topic
was my number one priority. I wanted to make sure that I had the attention of all my colleagues as it would be a much
more exciting and engaging presentation. Once I grabbed the attention of the listeners, the next main idea
was to explain in basic terms the problem and solution that I was completing, as well as the oppurtunity. The goal
of my project directly correlates to the oppurtunity that I adressed, so it was a perfect segway into talking
about my project. 

Once I completed this I decided it was important to give a brief page by page of what was already developed. Giving 
the listeners a brief and concise explanation and reasoning behind each page so I can explain why I am completing each
page. As well as the importance and significance behind the application I am developing. 

After this it was just going through a demonstration and questions part of the presentation.

The actual presentation in my opinion went very well. I have had lots of practice with presenation and practicing 
presentation skills in other classes, specifically junior seminar. This was able to help me stay composed and talk
through my slides slowly so all my colleagues could understand the points I was describing. The demonstration went
well as I was able to show and walk through the process of adding a workout to a users application. I thought this
was a good demonstration as we could go back and look at the evaluation and the change in the graph as well. In 
conclusion, it was a well prepared presentation that went accordingly to plan in my eyes.
