Regarding my computational artifact's current status, I am very happy with the work that has been completed up to this point. There have been a
lot of ups and downs, specifically regarding finalizing what I was going to develop as a product. I think for me, the research that I completed
within the first few months really helped shape my vision of what I want to develop and how that process will go.

Currently, my app contains at least a rough draft version of all the main selling points I want to include. This includes a user login and creation
system, workout log, visuals, and evaluation to provide feedback to the user, an awards system to add gameification, a recommendation page, and a user
profile to easily track workout personal records of bench, squat, and deadlift. Within these pages, there are definitely more things that I want
to develop and add on, but I am really happy with the progress right now. 

One of the main things I want to further develop is the evaluation portion of my application. This is the main piece of my artifact. Finding an
app that provides the user with concise feedback is unheard of, so that is the problem that I aim to solve. To do this, I need to develop the 
best and simplest way to give this to the user. By gathering the most important pieces of feedback, trend analysis, and a few other points, I have
developed something that hasn't been included in fitness applications. Here is a base example of what that looks like right now.

As you can see, this consists of 2 major points: the graph and the feedback. The graph is currently still under development as I am working through
data handling and compression as more and more data points are input by the user. This is how the user will be able to view their progress
and understand what they can do better to continue to improve on their gym journey.

In conclusion, I am very happy with the application's current state, but still feel excited about the work that is to come in the next few months
of development.
