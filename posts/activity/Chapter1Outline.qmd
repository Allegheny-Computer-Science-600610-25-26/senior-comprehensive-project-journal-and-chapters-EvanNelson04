 This outline is super important in the developmental proccess. Knowing what is going to be put
 on the paper is a super important step before starting to write as it aids me to know where to
 start with each chapter. All the details for each chapter were carefully outlined and discussed
 with both my first and second readers to ensure that no important elements were left out of any
 part of the chapter. For each section I attempted to make sure that all areas were covered and not
 to leave any questions within the readers minds.
