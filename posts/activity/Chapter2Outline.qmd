Similar to the first outline, jotting down important things to consider while writing this chapter,
is really what I focused on within this outline. I didn't include the sources, but instead I emphasized
the importance of talking about thematic connections. Especially in the literature review, it is important
for me to talk about how this paper connects to my work and what it is adding to my knowledge.
