WorkoutEvaluator: IOS app that provides personalized exercise feedback through user-inputted information

My senior Comprehensive project aims to bridge the gap between fitness and free accessible
feedback and analysis. This is completed through a mobile IOS app that will provide the users
a simple way to track and evaluate their progress. This title WorkoutEvaluator was chosen because
of how it emphasizes the importance of the evaluation portion of the app. This is also emphasized 
in what comes after the app title.
