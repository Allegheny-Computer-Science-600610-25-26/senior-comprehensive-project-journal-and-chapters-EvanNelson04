## Introduction to Related Work

For my specific senior comprehensive project, the related work section has unique importance. Since I am developing
a fitness application, it is in the best interest of this project to focus on what other applications are out there
and their importance, just as much as papers. Delving into the fitness application realm gives me knowledge about
what is already out there and what other apps do well. Looking into different apps and seeing what exists and, in
this case, what doesn't exist, is important to study and research more. This is what I have completed and will be
sharing. I have lots of previous experience with many different fitness apps as well as different wearables that have
allowed me to be more knowledgeable about what exists and what doesn't. Having experience within this realm has 
also allowed me to understand what is important to include in a fitness app and what the significance of that
specific concept is. As fitness is becoming a more popular industry and lifestyle, there is an influx of apps 
that are being developed and created. There are thousands of fitness apps out there that aim to solve a similar problem. How can we best assist the user? 

On the other hand, it is essential to examine various research papers and studies that complement my study. Some
of the important themes to look at for my unique application are the methodology of app development and the importance of 
gameification within fitness applications. There are many different studies that talk about different aspects of my
project that will be important to note and talk about. Recently, there has been an influx of the amount of studies
completed to learn more about this growing lifestyle.
