## Introduction to Related Work

For my specific senior comprehensive project, the related work section has unique importance. Since I am developing
a fitness application, it is in the best interest of this project to focus on what other applications are out there
and their importance, just as much as papers. Delving into the fitness application realm gives me knowledge about
what is already out there and what other apps do well. Looking into different apps and seeing what exists and, in
this case, what doesn't exist, is important to study and research more. This is what I have completed and will be
sharing. I have lots of previous experience with many different fitness apps as well as different wearables that have
allowed me to be more knowledgeable about what exists and what doesn't. Having experience within this realm has 
also allowed me to understand what is important to include in a fitness app and what the significance of that
specific concept is. As fitness is becoming a more popular industry and lifestyle, there is an influx of apps 
that are being developed and created. There are thousands of fitness apps out there that aim to solve a similar problem. How can we best assist the user? 

On the other hand, it is essential to examine various research papers and studies that complement my study. Some
of the important themes to look at for my unique application are the methodology of app development and the importance of 
gameification within fitness applications. There are many different studies that talk about different aspects of my
project that will be important to note and talk about. Recently, there has been an influx of the amount of studies
completed to learn more about this growing lifestyle. 

## Review of Existing Aplications

### Whoop

Whoop is the only wearable device with a mobile application that I think is worth considering and looking into. For
a brief introduction, Whoop is a wearable device that consists of a mobile application and a website. As of the current
Whoop 5.0, there are three different tiered subscriptions. All of these subscriptions come with the device as long as you
are actively paying for the subscription. 
The first and cheapest option is Whoop One. This subscription comes with the following... 
    1. Whoop 4.0 wearable, which is the previous release with 5 5-day battery
    2. Provides sleep, strain, and recovery insights to the user
    3. Personalized coaching.
    4. VO2 Max & heart rate zones
    5. Women's Hormonal Insights 
This is the most affordable option at 199$ per year, providing the most basic insights that Whoop provides, but still
allowing the user to access many of the benefits of Whoop

The second subscription is the Whoop Peak, which comes with everything on Whoop One plus the following...
    1. Whoop 5.0 wearable, which is the most recent release with a 14+ day battery 
    2. Healthspan and Pace of Aging
    3. Health Monitor with health alerts 
    4. Real-Time stress monitors
This is the second subscription option coming in at 239$ per year. This is the first subscription containing the new Whoop 5.0 device.

The final subscription tier is Whoop Life, which contains everything on Whoop Peak, plus the following
    1. Whoop MG with 14+ day battery life
    2. Daily Blood Pressure insights (beta)
    3. Heart Screener with ECG readings
    4. On-demand AFib detection
This is Whoop's highest and most expensive subscription, coming in at 359$ per year. This is the first wearable to provide many of the new features, like Afib detection and more. 

I used Whoop for about three years when its most recent release was Whoop 4.0. This wearable and application does a great
job at providing the user insights about how hard they trained and whether it would be beneficial to take a rest day
or have a lighter workout the next day. The important thing to note within Whoop is that it is not directly similar
to the app I am creating. Whoop is not geared specifically towards weightlifting but more towards athletic activity. This
app does not provide the ability to track workouts or progress within the gym. My main focus with this app is to investigate
the importance of well-deployed visuals and graphs, as well as the importance of an intriguing UI. User experience within
a fitness app is important as it contributes to user engagement and consistent use of the app.

As you can see in this image, Whoop demonstrates a highly organized and well-structured UI and specifically 
in this image, a landing page. Doing research in this application, I found that the uniqueness of their visuals is 
something that users enjoyed while utilizing this app [Hietala2025]. Attempting to create visuals that can provide
the user with an easily readable way to analyze progress is something that I can draw from Whoop, as they very cleanly
provide the users with visuals. This aligns with the importance of my app in creating a clean UI and providing the users
with well-designed visuals.
