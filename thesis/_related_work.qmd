## Introduction to Related Work

For my specific senior comprehensive project, the related work section has unique importance. Since I am developing
a fitness application, it is in the best interest of this project to focus on what other applications are out there
and their importance, just as much as papers. Delving into the fitness application realm gives me knowledge about
what is already out there and what other apps do well. Looking into different apps and seeing what exists and, in
this case, what doesn't exist, is important to study and research more. This is what I have completed and will be
sharing. I have lots of previous experience with many different fitness apps as well as different wearables that have
allowed me to be more knowledgeable about what exists and what doesn't. Having experience within this realm has 
also allowed me to understand what is important to include in a fitness app and what the significance of that
specific concept is. As fitness is becoming a more popular industry and lifestyle, there is an influx of apps 
that are being developed and created. There are thousands of fitness apps out there that aim to solve a similar problem. How can we best assist the user? 

On the other hand, it is essential to examine various research papers and studies that complement my study. Some
of the important themes to look at for my unique application are the methodology of app development and the importance of 
gameification within fitness applications. There are many different studies that talk about different aspects of my
project that will be important to note and talk about. Recently, there has been an influx of the amount of studies
completed to learn more about this growing lifestyle. 

## Review of Existing Aplications

### Whoop

Whoop is the only wearable device with a mobile application that I think is worth considering and looking into. For
a brief introduction, Whoop is a wearable device that consists of a mobile application and a website. As of the current
Whoop 5.0, there are three different tiered subscriptions. All of these subscriptions come with the device as long as you
are actively paying for the subscription.


**Whoop One** is the first and most affordable subscription option. This plan includes:

- Whoop 4.0 wearable, the previous-generation device with a 5-day battery life  
- Sleep, strain, and recovery insights
- Personalized coaching
- VO2 max and heart-rate zones
- Women’s hormonal insights

This tier costs $199 per year and provides the core functionality of Whoop while remaining the lowest-cost option.

---

**Whoop Peak** is the mid-tier subscription and includes everything in Whoop One, plus:

- Whoop 5.0 wearable, the newest version with a 14+ day battery life
- Healthspan and pace-of-aging metrics
- Health Monitor with alerts
- Real-time stress monitoring

This subscription costs $239 per year and is the first tier that includes the new Whoop 5.0 device.

---

**Whoop Life** is the highest-tier subscription. It includes everything in Whoop Peak, along with:

- Whoop MG device with 14+ day battery life
- Daily blood pressure insights (beta)
- Heart Screener with ECG readings
- On-demand AFib detection

This is Whoop’s most advanced subscription, priced at $359 per year, and introduces medical-grade features such as
ECG and AFib detection.


I used Whoop for about three years when its most recent release was Whoop 4.0. This wearable and application does a great
job at providing the user insights about how hard they trained and whether it would be beneficial to take a rest day
or have a lighter workout the next day. The important thing to note within Whoop is that it is not directly similar
to the app I am creating. Whoop is not geared specifically towards weightlifting but more towards athletic activity. This
app does not provide the ability to track workouts or progress within the gym. My main focus with this app is to investigate
the importance of well-deployed visuals and graphs, as well as the importance of an intriguing UI. User experience within
a fitness app is important as it contributes to user engagement and consistent use of the app.

![Whoop UI Image](images/whoop.png)

As you can see in this image, Whoop demonstrates a highly organized and well-structured UI and specifically 
in this image, a landing page. Doing research in this application, I found that the uniqueness of their visuals is 
something that users enjoyed while utilizing this app (@Hietala2025). Attempting to create visuals that can provide
the user with an easily readable way to analyze progress is something that I can draw from Whoop, as they very cleanly
provide the users with visuals. This aligns with the importance of my app in creating a clean UI and providing the users
with well-designed visuals.

### Strong

Strong is a mobile workout tracking application that allows users to manually input exercises, sets, reps, and weights
to monitor progress over time. The app provides data visualization tools such as charts and personal records to help
users evaluate their strength progression. Like the my project, Strong emphasizes user input rather than wearable
data, focusing on the user’s engagement in tracking and reflecting on their workouts.

![Strong App Workout Log](images/strong.png)

Strong has many strengths within their app. Their main focus comes within an engaging workout log feature. You can
see within this image that it is very unique in the elements that the log contains. It allows the user to enter
in all their common data like weight, sets and repetitions, but it also allows the user to mark the set as a warm up
or a working set. The next feature that is unique is that it allows the user to write certain notes to themselves to
remember for next time like go up in weight or keep back straight. This workout log creates a unique way to engage
the users much more than your common fitness app would. On the contrary, the time it takes to enter in all the neccesary
information into this app would be much longer than other apps. I believe that there is an importance of keeping the
workout log to quick and short entries that contain only the neccesary data. By doing this it allows the user to enter
all the needed data in under ten to fifteen seconds. Users will not want to be typing away for minutes after their set
as it will take away from their workout. 

However, its primary limitation lies in its relatively static analytics—while it effectively logs performance, it offers
minimal personalized insights or evaluative feedback beyond numerical summaries. Users can see what they lifted and track
personal records, but the app does not interpret this data to provide actionable guidance or recommendations tailored to
individual progress. There is little indication of trends over time, patterns in strength gains or plateaus, or suggestions
for optimizing future workouts. This aspect is common in most if not all of the fitness apps out there currently, being able
to provide the user with feedback to aid future workouts is untapped. 

My app builds on this foundation by introducing a more dynamic evaluation model. Instead of only displaying raw numbers,
it analyzes patterns in user-entered data, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and generates personalized feedback to
guide future training. By combining detailed logging with intelligent, interpretable analytics, the app transforms static
workout data into actionable insights, empowering users to make more informed decisions and progress more efficiently
toward their strength goals.

 
### Fitbod

Fitbod is a mobile fitness application that focuses more on workout planning and recommendations. This app contains 
similar concepts to workout logging and workout tracking, but focuses on the workout planning aspect as its main selling
point. This application still provides the user with the important visuals, so the users can still see their progress or 
regression. It also contains a workout logging feature, which, in my opinion, is less emphasized compared to the strong app.
The main focus within Fitbod is their ability to aid the users in their workout planning, which is able to answer these
user questions: What should I work out today? How long should I wait before working out my legs again? Has my muscle recovered
long enough to work out that muscle group again?

![Fitbod UI Picture](images/fitbod.png)

Fitbods' major strength and focus is their ability to aid users in workout planning. One of the major concepts
that this page includes is monitored recovery. After the user logs a workout, Fitbod records the exercises and assigns
a percentage of recovery (0-100%) to each muscle group based on the intensity of the workout. Meaning that if the user
records a workout that contains 3 chest exercises, the recovery score for the user's chest will be closer to 0% while
the recovery score for legs will be closer to 100% as there was no recorded exercise that focused on legs. This is then
portrayed within a heat map for the user's visual aid, which displays which muscles are fresh and which are fatigued. This
is a great concept to help the user understand which muscle group to focus on within their next workout. This system also
contains AI-powered suggestions. From researching this further, the recovery score is a key component of Fitbod's algorithm,
which will use this information to suggest a certain workout for the user. For example, if a muscle group is very fatigued,
it will recommend a different muscle group to train next. You are able as the user to change these recovery scores if you
feel like the system didn't correctly portray your recovery status. 

Each Fitness application has a strong suit and a selling point; whether it be a workout log, recommendations, or visuals, there
has to be something that your app does better than everyone else to stand out. In this case, Fitbod hands down completes
workout planning and recommendations better than any other app in the industry. 

As every app has its strengths, there are always limitations to any application. In this case, since fitbod is providing 
the user with similar information that you could receive from a personal trainer, arguably better and more accessible than
a personal trainer, it comes at a cost. Fitbod requires a subscription that is either 15.99$ per month or 95.99$ per year. The
yearly plan is much more cost-efficient compared to the monthly plan. On the contrary, if you were to compare this price
to the price of a personal trainer, the value is much better. As talked about by author Aneta Niepytalska, the cost of a
personal trainer can range from 60-100$, depending on where you live (@Niepytalska2025). For many, this can be a steep price
to pay for feedback, which makes the Fitbod cost look great.

My app will build on the importance of user accessibility. Being able to provide the user with feedback and suggestions like
Fitbod, but also feedback on their workouts, as well as trend analysis, is something that hasn't been completed yet. By completing
this aspect and delivering an evaluation page that provides the user with similar feedback that is simple and concise, it
can provide the user with the necessary information while not overloading the user with information. By
completing the evaluation while giving it to the users without needing a paid subscription is something that is unheard
but something that I believe every gym-goer deserves better yet needs.

### JEFIT

JEFIT is a long-standing workout tracking application designed to help users plan, record, and review their training sessions. The
app allows users to manually log exercises, sets, reps, and weights, and it includes one of the largest prebuilt exercise libraries
available in a consumer fitness app. Like Strong and like the proposed project, JEFIT relies heavily on user-entered data rather than
biometric inputs from wearables, emphasizing detailed workout documentation and long-term progress tracking.

JEFIT’s primary strength is its structured workout planning environment. Users can build routines from a large catalog of exercises,
organize them into weekly training cycles, and follow them step-by-step during a workout session. The interface highlights rest timers,
previous performance, and target rep ranges, helping users stay consistent and organized in the gym. The app also supports extensive note-taking
and includes options for tracking time under tension, tempo, and training logs that can be revisited to evaluate how a session felt or performed.
This provides a highly organized workout experience that appeals to users who prefer detailed, template-driven training plans. This training
plan builds upon the workout planning from Fitbod. The workout planning style for JEFIT is different as it allows users to pick exercises
to build and create their own workouts. 

![Jefit App Image](images/jefit.png)

Within this image it displays the ability to pick from a large group of different programs to aid the user in getting started. These different
workouts have different target audiences. For example, one audience could be user's training to become a professional bodybuilder, or the user
may be a 50 year old dad that wants to stay active and go to the gym consistently. You can also see in this image like every other app it has
a way for users to track their workouts and progress through user inputted data. As well as containing a way for others to see your data and
personal records if they are your friends in app. 

The limitations in this app for me come from the amount of time it takes to input data. The app makes it as easy as they can wih the format
provided but inputting every set you've completed along with weight and repetitions can take time away from a workout. I think it is important
to note that within my application, the user is advised to enter their first and only set of each exercise. Studies have shown that your
first working set of an exercise is often the strongest set as long as you have properly warmed up the muscle you are utilizing. This is
because you are performing with the least amount of muscle fatigue, allowing for the largest force production. As you perform following
sets, the muscle fatigue accumulates leading to a performace decline whether it be weight or repetitions. This has driven the component
of only requiring the first set from a user. As the subsequent sets are of utmost importance to muscle breakdown and hypertrophy, the first
set is usually when people will have personal records whether in weight or repetitions, which is the resoning behind reccomending the 
user to input their first set of an exercise. 

JEFIT like most of the other fitness applications currently available, requires a subscription for their "premium services". The monthly subscription
is 12.99$ while their yearly subscription is 69.99$, again making the yearly subscription much more cost effective. However within this app, the free
version does not give you access to any of their real selling points so unless you pay for the subscription the app may not contribute to a person's
progress.

---

**Paying for the premium subscription gives you access to the following**:

- Removes all ads
- Access to advanced training reports, charts and analytics
- Includes professional audio cues and exercise tips
- Unlimited smartwatch workouts
- Premium workout plans
- Ability to compare workouts with friends


However, despite its strong organizational tools, JEFIT’s analytics remain largely static. While it displays charts, personal records, and historical
averages, the app rarely interprets those trends or provides meaningful feedback beyond raw statistics. Users can view numbers, but the app does not
generate insights about performance patterns, identify plateaus, or suggest adjustments based on user behavior. As my project aims to complete this problem,
this is similar throughout al of the fitness apps I am diving into. Paying for this subscription gives the user access to many important tools that can
help the user but I finid it hard to believe there is a better tool than feedback and reccomendations to the user.

### Hevy

Hevy is a modern workout tracking application designed to provide a clean, streamlined experience for logging strength training sessions. Hevy centers on manual
user input—exercises, sets, reps, and weights—rather than wearable integration. The app is known for its minimalist interface, fast logging workflow, and 
community-oriented features that let users share workouts and progress with friends or followers. This is a very important app to compare and talk about in
comparison to my app. This apps selling point is the simplicity and how straight to the point the app is. This app doesn't pride itself in innovations and
uniqueness but rather in simplicity and a well designed UI.

This app contains of three major concepts, workout logging, measure progress and community motivation. These are the three conponents of this app that
they have decided to develop and make stand out. The workout log is similar to other apps in the aspect of entering exercise, weight and repetitions
as well as labeling the set as working or warm-up and having the ability to add notes. Once the user inputs their workout data, it gets uploaded to
their personal data charts and visuals. Within this page the user has the ability to visualize their progress and see personal records for the
specified exercise. Once again the focus point being simplicity and a well designed UI. Finally they provide the ability to join a community. User's are
able to join communities to follow other athletes that use the app, like and comment on workouts and save other athlete's workout routines.

This application in my opinion is the most similar to what I am developing. As you can see in the image, this app focuses being simplicity and user experience. The Hevy app does
not overload the user with loads of information and visuals but keeps it simple to allow the user to easily visualize progress. The main difference is that
Hevy does come with a paid subscription that compared to other apps is much cheaper. This subscription has three options: 2.99$ per month, 23.99$ per year,
or 74.99$ for a one-time lifetime fee. This is because it is a much simpler app that thrives at what it aims to complete but lacks of some of the components
that Strong or Fitbod contain.

Hevy’s biggest strength lies in its simplicity and usability. The workout log is highly intuitive, allowing users to enter sets quickly, duplicate previous
session data, and make adjustments without navigating through cluttered menus. The design emphasizes clarity: past performance is shown directly below each
exercise, and graphs for volume or personal records are only one tap away. Hevy also includes helpful features like custom exercises, supersets, rest timers,
and the ability to attach notes to individual sets. This creates a fluid logging experience ideal for users who want efficiency without sacrificing
detail.

![Hevy application image](images/hevy.png)

Hevy’s biggest strength lies in its simplicity and usability. As you can see in the image, this app is much more simple within the design which helps users to understand
how to use the application much better than a more complicated UI. The workout log is highly intuitive, allowing users to enter sets quickly, duplicate previous
session data, and make adjustments without navigating through cluttered menus. The design emphasizes clarity: past performance is shown directly below each
exercise, and graphs for volume or personal records are only one tap away. Hevy also includes helpful features like custom exercises, supersets, rest timers,
and the ability to attach notes to individual sets. This creates a fluid logging experience ideal for users who want efficiency without sacrificing
detail.

However, similar to the other applications, Hevy’s analytics remain largely basic. While the app generates charts, volume graphs, and personal best summaries, it does not
interpret these data points or provide personalized training insights. Users can view trends, but the app does not identify plateaus, highlight meaningful performance 
changes, or offer recommendations based on logging history. The proposed project extends beyond these limitations by introducing an adaptive evaluation system that interprets 
user-entered workout data, generates individualized feedback, and delivers deeper performance analysis rather than merely presenting raw progression graphs.

## Review of Existing Literature

Developing an effective health and fitness application requires more than simply tracking data—it depends on
understanding how users stay motivated, how behavior change occurs, and which design choices actually support
long-term engagement. Existing research on mobile health apps provides a critical foundation for this work.
Studies in this area examine how design features, such as feedback, rewards, and gamification, influence user
adherence, highlighting both successes and common shortcomings in current app approaches. Reviewing this body
of literature is essential for identifying evidence-based strategies, avoiding ineffective design patterns, and
grounding the development of my project in proven behavioral and motivational principles.  This context ensures
that the app not only functions technically but is also aligned with research-backed methods that promote consistent
use and meaningful health outcomes.

### Gamification Use and Design in Popular Health and Fitness Mobile Applications (Cotton and Patel, 2018)

Mobile health and fitness applications have rapidly expanded in popularity, offering users convenient ways to
monitor workouts, track biometrics, and support healthy behavior change. A key design strategy used in many of
these applications is gamification, defined as the integration of game-like elements, such as goals, challenges,
rewards, or feedback. This aims to increase user motivation and adherence. Recent research has examined how gamification
is implemented across commercial health and fitness apps and whether these design choices align with
behavioral-science principles.

One of the most influential analyses in this area is the study by Cotton and Patel (2018), who evaluated the 50
most popular free health and fitness apps from the Apple App Store. Their findings showed that 64% of apps included
at least one gamification feature. The most common elements were goal-setting (78%), social influence (78%),
and challenges (63%). In contrast, classic game mechanics such as points (6%) and levels (3%) were rarely used.
Cotton and Patel argued that while gamification is widely present, the depth of behavioral-science integration remains limited.
Notably, none of the evaluated apps used behavioral-economics-based strategies such as loss aversion, variable reinforcement,
or probability distortion—mechanisms shown to influence habit formation and motivation in other domains.

![Results Table](images/Cotton_Patel.png)

Talking about the results and this experiment specifically, it delves into different mobile applications and
what each app contains in terms of gameification. These categories include goals, high scores, streaks, collaborations,
challenges, etc. It is important to note that not all of these apps within the study are fitness apps, but they contain
many running, cycling, and weight loss apps. So to specify, apps within all realms of fitness lifestyle. 

I think that this brief experimental study is a good introduction and overview of what is important to include
within a fitness app. This study helped me to understand roughly what percentage of apps include certain aspects
of app development that my app includes. Knowing and recognizing that this is a very brief study to categorize what
important aspects most fitness apps include was important background information for me to gather.

### Variously and freely to use: Exploring routine and innovative use of fitness apps from a self-management perspective

Moving forward from the previous article, I now think it is important to dive into the use of fitness apps. The
article investigates how individuals use fitness applications by applying an "exploration–exploitation
framework". Instead of treating the use of fitness apps as a simple active or inactive binary, the study identifies two 
major usage patterns: routine use and innovative use. Routine use occurs when users habitually rely on the app
for consistent tracking, guidance, or daily routines. Innovative use occurs when users explore new features, engage
with the app intermittently, or use it during spikes of motivation.

The researchers developed a theoretical model combining goal-setting theory with exploration–exploitation concepts 
and used user data to evaluate how these behaviors manifest over time. Their findings show that fitness-app engagement 
fluctuates, and users often shift between stable routines and more experimental patterns. The study highlights that user
needs and motivations change dynamically, meaning effective fitness apps must adapt to different usage modes.

This study is important because it goes beyond basic metrics like downloads or step counts and instead focuses on how people
actually use fitness apps over time. Its findings reveal several key insights:

 - **Fitness-app engagement is not linear.** Users rarely stick to the same behavior pattern. They often change between routine and exploratory use depending on motivation, goals, or life context.  
 - **Retention depends on flexibility.** Apps designed for only one type of usage (e.g., daily routine tracking) may fail to satisfy users who prefer occasional or experimental use.
 - **Long-term success of fitness apps is linked to adapting to changing user goals.**
 - **Re-engagement features have real value.** Innovative users often return during goal shifts or motivational bursts, meaning apps should support smooth “re-entry” without penalizing inactivity.

   ---

For researchers and developers, the experiment shows that understanding behavioral patterns gives more meaningful design guidance than 
simply measuring activity levels. It emphasizes user diversity and highlights the need for adaptive design for any modern fitness 
or health app.

The findings of this study directly inform the design and goals of my mobile fitness application, which relies on user-entered 
workout data. The article’s distinction between routine and innovative usage patterns is especially relevant because my app must 
accommodate users whose engagement levels may vary over time. Some individuals may consistently log every workout as part of an 
established fitness routine, while others may return only during specific motivation peaks, new training phases, or when attempting 
to get back into shape. The study shows that these patterns are normal and expected, which supports designing the interface to be 
flexible, intuitive, and low-friction regardless of how frequently someone interacts with the app.

The article also highlights that users shift between different goals and motivational states, meaning the app must not assume a single,
stable form of usage. For my project, this means implementing features that make both consistent logging and occasional re-entry 
effortless. For example, the app should allow users to quickly enter workout details without navigating through complicated menus,
and it should clearly present progress trends even if data entries are not perfectly consistent. This aligns with the study’s insight 
that fitness apps need to support both “exploitative” routine behaviors and “exploratory” sporadic interactions.

Another important connection is the study’s emphasis on designing for re-engagement. Because innovative users commonly return after gaps 
in use, my app must handle periods of inactivity without penalizing the user or making the returning process feel overwhelming. Instead 
of assuming continuous adherence, the app should encourage users to pick up where they left off by summarizing recent history or 
highlighting how new entries contribute to long-term patterns. This approach directly reflects the study’s conclusion that fitness apps 
should adapt to the fluid, shifting nature of user motivation.

Overall, the article strengthens the theoretical justification for the core design principles of my project. By showing that real fitness applic
users exhibit evolving use patterns, the study validates my focus on creating a logging system that is simple, adaptable, 
and welcoming to both daily and occasional users. Its findings emphasize that user-entered data apps must be designed around flexibility 
and engagement over time, which directly shapes how my project approaches user flow, data entry, and presentation of long-term progress.

### A Systematic Review on Visualizations for Self-Generated Health Data for Daily Activities

Kim {Kim2022} presents a systematic review of studies that evaluate visualizations for self-generated health data collected during daily 
activities. The review breaks down what kinds of visualizations researchers used (like timelines, dashboards, and comparison charts), what types
of data they focused on (such as steps, sleep, or exercise), how these visualizations were tested (usability tests, walkthroughs, or real-world trials), 
and what outcomes they aimed to support, like helping users gain insight, change behavior, or make health decisions. From these studies Kim derives an evaluation framework 
that categorizes visualization utility across levels of actionability — from simple awareness/monitoring up to supporting concrete actions or 
clinical decisions. The review also identifies recurring design challenges (cognitive overload, ambiguous units, inconsistent timescales) and 
recommends evaluation best practices.


## Thematic Connections 

Across the selected research and the fitness applications examined (Hevy, Fitbod, WHOOP, Strong, and JEFIT), several shared themes emerge that
highlight how modern health technologies attempt to motivate users, support long-term engagement, and provide meaningful feedback. These 
themes directly correlate to my project.

### Engagement and Motivation Through Design

The gamification paper emphasizes how features like challenges, streaks, achievements, and progress indicators can boost short-term motivation 
but must be thoughtfully designed to sustain long-term use. This theme appears clearly in real apps:

 - **Fitbod** uses adaptive workout recommendations that give users a sense of progress through muscle fatigue tracking and streaks.
 - **Hevy** incorporates badges, workout milestones, and leaderboards that align with the paper’s findings on motivational triggers.
 - **JEFIT** includes goals, calendars, and training plans that resemble early forms of gamification.

    ---


The literature and the apps both show that engagement is not just about collecting data—it’s about creating an experience where users feel 
rewarded and see evidence of improvement. By providing the users with a unique experience within the application, this creates the oppurtunity 
for long term engagement. I want users to use this app to help them through every workout in the gym. The goal isn't to create an app that
has users utilize the app for 1 month stints, but rather to use it for years of training. By learning and researching about user engagement
through design, it helps me to understand what within an application can create long term engagement.

*** The Role of Ease-of-Use and Habit Formation

Research on fitness app usage highlights that users often stop using apps when tracking becomes inconvenient, repetitive, or overly manual. 
Through the research in the article that talks about routine and innovative use of fitness apps {Li-Sun-Wang-Guo2024}, it is evident that it is 
easier for someone who has the routine of workout tracking to use these fitness apps. Creating a way for the users to easily find this routine 
of workout logging and tracking is of utmost importance. This helped me to develop and understand the importance of creating my app in a simple 
and easy-to-use way. Meaning that if my app becomes too complicated to enter data or visualize data, it is harder for the users to find that 
routine. My app has a simple way to input data that only takes about 15 seconds, making it much easier for users to implement this in their 
daily gym routine.

We see this exemplified within some of the apps that I previously talked about.

 - **Strong** focuses on fast, minimal-effort logging, by tapping the exercise and enter sets. This displays the research that simple interfaces support habit formation.
 - **Hevy** uses templates and quick-add features to speed up workflow.
 - **Fitbod** automates workout planning entirely, reducing the user’s cognitive load.

   ---

The apps demonstrate the same principles found in the literature: users stick with systems that minimize effort and streamline self-tracking.

*** Visualization as the Bridge Between Data and Action

The visualization review shows that how data is presented determines whether users can interpret trends, identify patterns, or make behavior 
changes. The research stresses multi-time-scale charts, clear labeling, and actionable insights. When researching different fitness applications,
a majority of the time, the thing that helps an app stand out is how the data is visualized. To create a successful fitness app, there has to 
be a well-constructed visualization of the user's data. This visualization needs to provide the user with the ability to easily analyze the 
data to see progression or regression. If the user can't tell if what they are doing is progressing, then the visual has failed to complete 
the task it aims to solve.

These apps provide strong examples of these visuals:

 - **WHOOP** excels at data visualization, giving users daily, weekly, and monthly reports on strain, recovery, and sleep.
 - **Fitbod** visualizes muscle fatigue and session volume through color coding and bar charts.
 - **Strong and Hevy** provide personal record charts, volume graphs, and exercise history timelines.

   ---

These apps show how effective visualizations transform the user's data into insights that align with the paper’s claim that clarity and context 
drive understanding and action. This relates to the work within my application that I am creating. A unique visual that stands out within the fitness
application industry, which solves the issue of simplicity.

## Summary

The insights from three research areas of gamification, fitness app usage, and data visualization, combined with the practical lessons from 
apps like Hevy, Fitbod, WHOOP, Strong, and JEFIT, highlight the core design principles needed for an effective fitness-tracking system. The 
literature consistently shows that long-term engagement depends on meaningful motivation, simple tracking and logging, and clear visual feedback.
The apps are live demonstrations of how these ideas work in real products. WHOOP and Fitbod emphasize data-driven personalization, Strong and Hevy show 
the value of simple and fast manual logging, and all incorporate elements of progress feedback that align with gamification research. The 
visualization paper further reinforces that users must be able to clearly interpret the relationship between their actions, manually entered 
data, and trends if they are going to make informed decisions or sustain behavior change. Together, these themes directly inform 
the design goals of my project: creating a fitness application that interprets user-entered data, supports effortless user 
input, and presents information through personalized visualizations. In summary, both research and existing apps point toward the 
same conclusion: the creation of a successful fitness application must seamlessly merge motivation, usability, and insight. My project draws from these findings 
to build a platform that not only tracks data but transforms it into meaningful feedback that encourages long-term consistency and healthier 
habits.
