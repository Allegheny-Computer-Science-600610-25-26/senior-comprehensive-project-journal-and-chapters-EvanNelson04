## Introduction to Related Work

For my specific senior comprehensive project, the related work section has unique importance. Since I am developing
a fitness application, it is in the best interest of this project to focus on what other applications are out there
and their importance, just as much as papers. Delving into the fitness application realm gives me knowledge about
what is already out there and what other apps do well. Looking into different apps and seeing what exists and, in
this case, what doesn't exist, is important to study and research more. This is what I have completed and will be
sharing. I have lots of previous experience with many different fitness apps as well as different wearables that have
allowed me to be more knowledgeable about what exists and what doesn't. Having experience within this realm has 
also allowed me to understand what is important to include in a fitness app and what the significance of that
specific concept is. As fitness is becoming a more popular industry and lifestyle, there is an influx of apps 
that are being developed and created. There are thousands of fitness apps out there that aim to solve a similar problem. How can we best assist the user? 

On the other hand, it is essential to examine various research papers and studies that complement my study. Some
of the important themes to look at for my unique application are the methodology of app development and the importance of 
gameification within fitness applications. There are many different studies that talk about different aspects of my
project that will be important to note and talk about. Recently, there has been an influx of the amount of studies
completed to learn more about this growing lifestyle. 

## Review of Existing Aplications

### Whoop

Whoop is the only wearable device with a mobile application that I think is worth considering and looking into. For
a brief introduction, Whoop is a wearable device that consists of a mobile application and a website. As of the current
Whoop 5.0, there are three different tiered subscriptions. All of these subscriptions come with the device as long as you
are actively paying for the subscription.


**Whoop One** is the first and most affordable subscription option. This plan includes:

- Whoop 4.0 wearable, the previous-generation device with a 5-day battery life  
- Sleep, strain, and recovery insights
- Personalized coaching
- VO2 max and heart-rate zones
- Women’s hormonal insights

This tier costs $199 per year and provides the core functionality of Whoop while remaining the lowest-cost option.

---

**Whoop Peak** is the mid-tier subscription and includes everything in Whoop One, plus:

- Whoop 5.0 wearable, the newest version with a 14+ day battery life
- Healthspan and pace-of-aging metrics
- Health Monitor with alerts
- Real-time stress monitoring

This subscription costs $239 per year and is the first tier that includes the new Whoop 5.0 device.

---

**Whoop Life** is the highest-tier subscription. It includes everything in Whoop Peak, along with:

- Whoop MG device with 14+ day battery life
- Daily blood pressure insights (beta)
- Heart Screener with ECG readings
- On-demand AFib detection

This is Whoop’s most advanced subscription, priced at $359 per year, and introduces medical-grade features such as
ECG and AFib detection.


I used Whoop for about three years when its most recent release was Whoop 4.0. This wearable and application does a great
job at providing the user insights about how hard they trained and whether it would be beneficial to take a rest day
or have a lighter workout the next day. The important thing to note within Whoop is that it is not directly similar
to the app I am creating. Whoop is not geared specifically towards weightlifting but more towards athletic activity. This
app does not provide the ability to track workouts or progress within the gym. My main focus with this app is to investigate
the importance of well-deployed visuals and graphs, as well as the importance of an intriguing UI. User experience within
a fitness app is important as it contributes to user engagement and consistent use of the app.

As you can see in this image, Whoop demonstrates a highly organized and well-structured UI and specifically 
in this image, a landing page. Doing research in this application, I found that the uniqueness of their visuals is 
something that users enjoyed while utilizing this app [Hietala2025]. Attempting to create visuals that can provide
the user with an easily readable way to analyze progress is something that I can draw from Whoop, as they very cleanly
provide the users with visuals. This aligns with the importance of my app in creating a clean UI and providing the users
with well-designed visuals.

### Strong

Strong is a mobile workout tracking application that allows users to manually input exercises, sets, reps, and weights
to monitor progress over time. The app provides data visualization tools such as charts and personal records to help
users evaluate their strength progression. Like the my project, Strong emphasizes user input rather than wearable
data, focusing on the user’s engagement in tracking and reflecting on their workouts.

![Strong App Workout Log](images/strong.png)

Strong has many strengths within their app. Their main focus comes within an engaging workout log feature. You can
see within this image that it is very unique in the elements that the log contains. It allows the user to enter
in all their common data like weight, sets and repetitions, but it also allows the user to mark the set as a warm up
or a working set. The next feature that is unique is that it allows the user to write certain notes to themselves to
remember for next time like go up in weight or keep back straight. This workout log creates a unique way to engage
the users much more than your common fitness app would. On the contrary, the time it takes to enter in all the neccesary
information into this app would be much longer than other apps. I believe that there is an importance of keeping the
workout log to quick and short entries that contain only the neccesary data. By doing this it allows the user to enter
all the needed data in under ten to fifteen seconds. Users will not want to be typing away for minutes after their set
as it will take away from their workout. 

However, its primary limitation lies in its relatively static analytics—while it effectively logs performance, it offers
minimal personalized insights or evaluative feedback beyond numerical summaries. Users can see what they lifted and track
personal records, but the app does not interpret this data to provide actionable guidance or recommendations tailored to
individual progress. There is little indication of trends over time, patterns in strength gains or plateaus, or suggestions
for optimizing future workouts. This aspect is common in most if not all of the fitness apps out there currently, being able
to provide the user with feedback to aid future workouts is "untapped". 

My app builds on this foundation by introducing a more dynamic evaluation model. Instead of only displaying raw numbers,
it analyzes patterns in user-entered data, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and generates personalized feedback to
guide future training. By combining detailed logging with intelligent, interpretable analytics, the app transforms static
workout data into actionable insights, empowering users to make more informed decisions and progress more efficiently
toward their strength goals.
