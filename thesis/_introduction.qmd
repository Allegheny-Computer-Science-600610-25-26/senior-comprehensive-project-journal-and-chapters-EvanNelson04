# Introduction

## 1.1 - Background

This Senior Comprehensive Project aims to address the problem within the fitness domain. Specifically, 
the lack of accessible, personalized feedback in gym training. Millions of people visit gyms each day
with the goal of improving their health and performance, yet many struggle to determine whether they are
training effectively. Questions such as “Am I using the right form?”, “How much weight should I lift?”
, or “Is my progress on track?” often go unanswered without a personal trainer or advanced tracking
tools. To bridge this gap, my iOS application provides real-time, user input data-driven feedback 
designed to guide.

The gym lifestyle has been actively growing for over 20 years. In 2000, around 32.8 million people had
active gym memberships in the United States. Since then, that number has more than doubled to approximately
77 million in 2024, with predictions estimating 85–90 million memberships by 2030 (Kerxhaliu). As the
number of gym-goers continues to rise, so does the portion of this population seeking feedback—whether
through phone applications, personal trainers, or wearables. Currently, about 29% of gym-goers work
with personal trainers (Kerxhaliu). However, the average hourly rate for a professional personal
trainer ranges from $40 to $70 (Niepytalska), which can significantly increase the cost of
maintaining a fitness routine. What if there were a way to provide this guidance in a simple,
free iOS app on your phone?

In this day and age, almost everyone carries their smartphone wherever they go—to work, to dinner, to
their children’s soccer games, and to the gym. This constant presence presents a unique opportunity:
fitness guidance and feedback can be delivered directly into the hands of users, anytime and anywhere.
By leveraging this accessibility, an app can provide personalized, real-time feedback would complete 
something that hasn't neccesarily been completed. In 2024, fitness apps were downloaded a total of 850
million times, yet only 345 million people actively used them (Curry). This gap highlights a clear
opportunity for apps that not only attract users but also maintain engagement by delivering meaningful,
easy-to-access insights. My iOS application aims to fill this gap, offering concise and actionable 
workout guidance that keeps users motivated and informed without requiring additional cost or equipment.
