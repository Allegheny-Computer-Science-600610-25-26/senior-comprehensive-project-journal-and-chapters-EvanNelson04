# Introduction

## Background

This Senior Comprehensive Project aims to address the problem within the fitness domain. Specifically, 
the lack of accessible, personalized feedback in gym training. Millions of people visit gyms each day
with the goal of improving their health and performance, yet many struggle to determine whether they are
training effectively. Questions such as “Am I using the right form?”, “How much weight should I lift?”
, or “Is my progress on track?” often go unanswered without a personal trainer or advanced tracking
tools. To bridge this gap, my iOS application provides real-time, user input data-driven feedback 
designed to guide.

The gym lifestyle has been actively growing for over 20 years. In 2000, around 32.8 million people had
active gym memberships in the United States. Since then, that number has more than doubled to approximately
77 million in 2024, with predictions estimating 85–90 million memberships by 2030 (Kerxhaliu). As the
number of gym-goers continues to rise, so does the portion of this population seeking feedback—whether
through phone applications, personal trainers, or wearables. Currently, about 29% of gym-goers work
with personal trainers (Kerxhaliu). However, the average hourly rate for a professional personal
trainer ranges from $40 to $70 (Niepytalska), which can significantly increase the cost of
maintaining a fitness routine. What if there were a way to provide this guidance in a simple,
free iOS app on your phone?

In this day and age, almost everyone carries their smartphone wherever they go—to work, to dinner, to
their children’s soccer games, and to the gym. This constant presence presents a unique opportunity:
fitness guidance and feedback can be delivered directly into the hands of users, anytime and anywhere.
By leveraging this accessibility, an app can provide personalized, real-time feedback would complete 
something that hasn't neccesarily been completed. In 2024, fitness apps were downloaded a total of 850
million times, yet only 345 million people actively used them (Curry). This gap highlights a clear
opportunity for apps that not only attract users but also maintain engagement by delivering meaningful,
easy-to-access insights. My iOS application aims to fill this gap, offering concise and actionable 
workout guidance that keeps users motivated and informed without requiring additional cost or equipment.

## Overview of Completed Work

The current build of the project includes a working iOS application with all core components implemented.
This app is made from three main ideas, workout progress tracking, providing evaluation and feedback and
local data storage. 

Workout progress tracking consists of 2 different areas. Primarily is the concept of
logging your workout. In my app the goal is to keep it simple, taking in user-inputted data that consists
of muscle group, exercise, weight, repetitions. Logging these 4 things in my developed app takes the user
under 15 seconds. This is beneficial as it provides the user the ability to input data directly after
a completed set that doesn't take up minutes. Once the user inputs the data it then gets shot to 2 different
areas, workout log and visuals. Once the user inputs the data they are able to readily view this within
their history log of workouts, providing the user with the information they provided along with the
date that it was completed on. This is one way that the user will be able to visualize all the different
exercises they have completed on any given day. From there it activates the other visual part that is
emphasized. The user is able to see the data for any specific exercise they have inputted. This will
aid the user in discovering trends and progress. You can easily view and recognize if you are bench
pressing more weight than last time and how much it has progressed in the last month. The visuals
are a large emphasis of this project, being able to provide the user with a simple and easy way
to visualize if they are progressing or regressing goes a long way in the scope of fitness apps.

Providing evaluation in my opinion is the main emphasis of this project. Within regards to the fitness
app realm, there is not an app that can provide concise and specific feedback to aid the user in their
gym journey. In my opinion too much feedback or too complicated feedback can be offputting for users
for many different reasons. Lots of apps provide the user with 10 different graphs or 10 different data
points that stand out, but a lot of the time the user may not understand what they are looking at and
receiving. There has to be a way to provide the user feedback in 2-4 bulletpoints that can help them
recognize that is good and what is bad so that they dont get stuck in a loop of creating bad habits
within the gym. Well essentially this is what my app will have that will stand out. For example, if the
user inputs exercises of a certain muscle group more than 2-3 times a week my app will tell the user
that they are overtraining that muscle group. The basic science is that everytime you use a muscle group
you are essentially creating micro tears in this muscle that need time to regrow bigger and stronger. If 
it does not get that time to rest and regrow then essentially you will not see any progress. Things like
this are not common for new gym-goers to know, so why not aid them in this journey. This evaluation will
also be able to look at and evaluate trends. In the last month am I progressing or regressing? Well my app
will let the user know this immediately after a data entry. Providing this feedback in my opinion is the
missing puzzle piece in the fitness industry.

Finally reaching the point of local data storage is an important milestone in developing my app. Local
storage allows the app to save information directly on the user’s device, which is essential for
reliability, performance, and user experience. It does this by saving a JSON file on the user's device.
A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format used to store and organize data in a structured way
using key-value pairs. It’s easy for both humans to read and computers to process, making it ideal for
app development. In my iOS app, a JSON file can store information such as workouts, exercises, or
personal records locally. This helps keep the app’s data organized and easily accessible for future use
or syncing. By storing data locally, users can still access and record their workouts even without an
internet connection, making the app functional anywhere, including gyms or areas with poor service. It
also ensures data persistence, meaning user progress and personal records are saved between sessions
instead of being lost when the app closes. Additionally, local data storage enhances performance because
retrieving information from the device is much faster than communicating with a remote server. Lastly,
it supports better privacy and security, since sensitive fitness data remain on the user’s device, giving
them greater control over their personal information. Security in 2025 is more important than ever, as
data breaches and hacking attempts have become increasingly common. By prioritizing secure data handling
within my app, users can feel confident that their personal information is protected. This added layer
of security helps build trust and provides peace of mind while using the app.

The app was developed using Xcode and is currently tested directly on my iPhone through Developer Mode. My
primary focus at the beginning of the process was learning a new programming language, Swift, while also
understanding how to code, commit, and push changes to a GitHub repository within this new environment. Although
Xcode took some time to get comfortable with, trial and error combined with YouTube tutorials—especially those
focused on Swift basics, SwiftUI interface design, and Xcode project setup—helped me progress quickly. Comparing
Swift to Python also gave me valuable insight into how each language handles certain functions and where Swift
performs better for iOS app development.

I leveraged SwiftUI for the interface and used environment objects for data handling. The project was managed
through GitHub, ensuring version control and consistent code saving. Testing on my personal iPhone required enabling
Developer Mode, registering my device with Xcode, and configuring the necessary provisioning profiles to allow the
app to run outside the simulator.

Xcode also provides the option of using “Simulators” to run and test apps in development. A simulator is a software
tool that mimics the behavior of an actual iPhone or iPad on your computer, allowing you to see how your app would
look and function without needing a physical device. However, the downside is that the app may look or behave differently
on a real iPhone. Therefore, testing on a physical device was essential to ensure accurate appearance and functionality. 

## Personal Motivation "Why Me? Why This Project?"

This project aligns closely with my personal and academic interests in health technology and mobile app development.
I have always loved video games, and as I got older, I became interested in understanding how they work behind the
scenes. This project gave me the opportunity to finally explore that process and develop my own application from the
ground up. I am also deeply passionate about health and wellness, so being able to bridge the gap between fitness and
software development feels both meaningful and exciting. It represents a step toward creating technology that not only
functions well but also has a real impact on people’s daily lives. 

I have been an athlete my whole life, from my earliest years through college. I played soccer as soon as I could walk and run,
continued with tennis up until my junior year of college, and have tried just about every sport imaginable. Sports have always been
a central part of my life, keeping me active every day, whether through clubs or just playing with friends. This routine changed during
my junior year of college when I left the Allegheny College Men’s Tennis Team due to a lingering shoulder injury. After playing sports
my whole life, it felt strange not to be actively involved in a sport or hobby. To stay active, I decided to pursue a consistent gym
lifestyle, going 5–6 days a week. Thankfully, I already had some experience in the gym through teams and clubs, but without that foundation,
I would have had no idea where to start or how to define “success.” Through trial, learning from friends, and watching YouTube tutorials, I
gradually gained knowledge and confidence in the gym. That experience sparked the idea: what if there was an app that could track my progress
while providing personalized feedback to help me stay on track? I began experimenting with fitness apps like Whoop, Strong, Fitbod, and Hevy,
but none provided exactly what I was looking for. That gap inspired me to develop my own app, tailored to my fitness goals and workflow.
This process is especially unique because I am both the developer and a user of the app. Being able to experience the app firsthand allows me
to constantly evaluate features from a real-world perspective, ensuring usability, simple design, and functionality. This dual role enables me
to iterate quickly and create an application that is both practical and engaging for users like myself.

This proccess is especially unique as I am the developer for this app as well as someone who will be a user for this application. This unique
experience allows me to have a visual of what I want to create at all times of development. 

This background is why I feel particularly well-qualified for the developer role on this project. My academics at Allegheny College’s
CIS department has also provided me with a strong foundation in computer science, equipping me with the technical knowledge and problem-solving skills
needed to successfully design and implement a mobile application. Over the course of my studies, I have taken courses across nearly every
area of computer science, including software engineering, web design, computer security and programming languages. This breadth of
exposure has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with multiple coding languages and frameworks, giving me the ability to approach the technical
challenges of app development.

Two courses, in particular, have shaped my ability to contribute effectively to this project: Software Engineering and Web Design. Software Engineering
provided me with experience in professional development workflows, including collaborative sprints, version control, and team-based problem solving.
I learned how to write code that is not only functional but also readable and maintainable by other team members which is a critical skill for any large-scale project.
Understanding each function and code block in depth allows me to confidently iterate and expand the app while avoiding errors. Web Design, meanwhile, highlighted
the importance of user interface and user experience. Developing a clean and visually appealing interface is crucial for engaging users, particularly
in a mobile app where ease of navigation and clarity are essential. The lessons from this course ensure that the app I am building is not only technically advanced
but also user-friendly.

Beyond my academic preparation, my personal experiences have shaped my motivation and insight into this project. As a lifelong athlete, I have spent countless
hours understanding training, fitness, and performance, which gave me firsthand knowledge of what users look for in a health and fitness app. Transitioning
from organized sports to independent gym training revealed a gap in available tools for tracking and improving personal fitness progress. By combining this
personal experience with my technical expertise, I am able to create an application that addresses real user needs.



Overall, my combination of technical training, practical experience, and personal motivation provides a strong foundation for this project. I am confident 
in my ability to develop an engaging, and functional app that bridges the gap between software technology and health and wellness.
