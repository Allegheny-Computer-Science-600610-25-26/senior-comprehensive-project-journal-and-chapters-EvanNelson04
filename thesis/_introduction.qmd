# Introduction

## Background

This Senior Comprehensive Project aims to address the problem within the fitness domain. Specifically, 
the lack of accessible, personalized feedback in gym training. Millions of people visit gyms each day
with to improve their health and performance, yet many struggle to determine whether they are
training effectively. Questions such as “Am I using the right form?”, “How much weight should I lift?”,
"Is my progress on track?”, often goes unanswered without a personal trainer or advanced tracking.
To bridge this gap, my iOS application provides real-time, user input data-driven feedback 
designed to guide.

The gym lifestyle has been actively growing for over twenty years. In 2000, around 32.8 million people had
active gym memberships in the United States. Since then, that number has more than doubled to approximately
77 million in 2024, with predictions estimating 85–90 million memberships by 2030 (@Kerxhaliu). As the
number of gymgoers continues to rise, so does the portion of this population seeking feedback, whether
through phone applications, personal trainers, or wearables. Currently, about 29% of gymgoers work
with personal trainers (@Kerxhaliu). However, the average hourly rate for a professional personal
trainer ranges from $40 to $70 (@Niepytalska2025), which can significantly increase the cost of
maintaining a fitness routine. What if there were a way to provide this guidance in a simple,
free iOS app on your phone?

In this day and age, almost everyone carries their smartphone wherever they go. Whether it be to work, to dinner, to
their children’s soccer games or to the gym. This constant presence presents a unique opportunity:
Fitness guidance and feedback can be delivered directly to users' hands at any time and from anywhere.
By leveraging this accessibility, an app can provide personalized, real-time feedback that would complete 
something that hasn't neccesarily been completed. In 2024, fitness apps were downloaded a total of 850
million times, yet only 345 million people actively used them (@Curry2025). This gap highlights a clear
opportunity for apps that not only attract users but also maintain engagement by delivering meaningful,
easy-to-access insights. My iOS application aims to fill this gap, offering concise and actionable 
workout guidance that keeps users motivated and informed without requiring additional cost or equipment.

This raises the problem that I am driving to solve. Can feedback and analysis be provided to users through a simple
and concise free mobile iOS application?

## Overview of WorkoutTracker Application

This project includes a working iOS application with all core components implemented.
This app is made from three main ideas: workout progress tracking, providing evaluation and feedback, and
local data storage.

![My Application Image](images/AppImage.png)

Workout progress tracking consists of two different areas. Primarily is the concept of
logging your workout. In my app, the goal is to keep it simple, taking in user-inputted data that consists
of muscle group, exercise, weight, and repetitions. Logging these four things in my developed app takes the user
under fifteen seconds. This is beneficial as it provides the user with the ability to input data directly after
a completed set, which doesn't take up minutes. Once the user inputs the data, it then gets shot to two different
areas: the workout log and visuals. Once the user inputs the data, they can readily view this within
their history log of workouts, providing the user with the information they provided along with the
date that it was completed. This is one way that the user will be able to visualize all the different
exercises they have completed on any given day. From there, it activates the other visual part that is
emphasized. The user is able to see the data for any specific exercise they have entered. This will
aid the user in discovering trends and progress. You can easily view and recognize if you are bench
pressing more weight than last time and how much it has progressed in the last month. The visuals
are a large emphasis of this project, being able to provide the user with a simple and easy way
to visualize if they are progressing or regressing goes a long way in the scope of fitness apps.

Providing evaluation, in my opinion, is the main emphasis of this project. With regards to the fitness
app realm, no app that can provide concise and specific feedback to aid the user in their
gym journey. In my opinion, too much feedback or too complicated feedback can be off-putting for users
for many different reasons. Lots of apps provide the user with ten different graphs or ten different data
points that stand out, but a lot of the time, the user may not understand what they are looking at and
receiving. There has to be a way to provide the user feedback in two to four bullet points that can help them
recognize what is good and what is bad, so that they don't get stuck in a loop of creating bad habits. 
Well, essentially, this is what my app will have that will stand out. For example, if the
user inputs exercises of a certain muscle group more than two to three times a week, my app will tell the user
that they are overtraining that muscle group. The basic science is that every time you use a muscle group,
you are essentially creating micro tears in this muscle that need time to regrow bigger and stronger. If 
it does not get that time to rest and regrow, then essentially, you will not see any progress. Things like
this are not common for new gymgoers to know, so why not aid them in this journey? This evaluation will
also be able to look at and evaluate trends. In the last month, am I progressing or regressing? Well, my app
will let the user know this immediately after a data entry. Providing this feedback, in my opinion, is the
missing puzzle piece in the fitness industry.

Finally reaching the point of local data storage is an important milestone in developing my app. Local
storage allows the app to save information directly on the user’s device, which is essential for
reliability, performance, and user experience. It does this by saving a JSON file on the user's device.
A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format used to store and organize data in a structured way
using key-value pairs. It’s easy for both humans to read and computers to process, making it ideal for
app development. In my iOS app, a JSON file can store information such as workouts, exercises, or
personal records locally. This helps keep the app’s data organized and easily accessible for future use
or syncing. By storing data locally, users can still access and record their workouts even without an
internet connection, making the app functional anywhere, including gyms or areas with poor service. It
also ensures data persistence, meaning user progress and personal records are saved between sessions
instead of being lost when the app closes. Additionally, local data storage enhances performance because
retrieving information from the device is much faster than communicating with a remote server. Lastly,
it supports better privacy and security, since sensitive fitness data remains on the user’s device, giving
them greater control over their personal information. Security in 2025 is more important than ever, as
data breaches and hacking attempts have become increasingly common. By prioritizing secure data handling
within my app, users can feel confident that their personal information is protected. This added layer
of security helps build trust and provides peace of mind while using the app.

The app was developed using Xcode and is currently tested directly on my iPhone through Developer Mode. My
primary focus at the beginning of the process was learning a new programming language, Swift, while also
understanding how to code, commit, and push changes to a GitHub repository within this new environment. Although
Xcode took some time to get comfortable with, trial and error combined with YouTube tutorials—especially those
focused on Swift basics, SwiftUI interface design, and Xcode project setup—helped me progress quickly. Comparing
Swift to Python also gave me valuable insight into how each language handles certain functions and where Swift
performs better for iOS app development.

I leveraged SwiftUI for the interface and used environment objects for data handling. The project was managed
through GitHub, ensuring version control and consistent code saving. Testing on my personal iPhone required enabling
Developer Mode, registering my device with Xcode, and configuring the necessary provisioning profiles to allow the
app to run outside the simulator.

Xcode also provides the option of using “simulators” to run and test apps in development. A simulator is a software
tool that mimics the behavior of an actual iPhone or iPad on your computer, allowing you to see how your app would
look and function without needing a physical device. However, the downside is that the app may look or behave differently
on a real iPhone. Therefore, testing on a physical device was essential to ensure accurate appearance and functionality. 

## Personal Motivation: "Why Me? Why This Project?"

This project aligns closely with my personal and academic interests in health technology and mobile app development.
I have always loved video games, and as I got older, I became interested in understanding how they work behind the
scenes. This project allowed me to finally explore that process and develop my own application from the
ground up. I am also deeply passionate about health and wellness, so being able to bridge the gap between fitness and
software development feels both meaningful and exciting. It represents a step toward creating technology that not only
functions well but also has a real impact on people’s daily lives. 

I have been an athlete my whole life, from my earliest years through college. I played soccer as soon as I could walk and run,
continued with tennis up until my junior year of college, and have tried just about every sport imaginable. Sports have always been
a central part of my life, keeping me active every day, whether through clubs or just playing with friends. This routine changed during
my junior year of college when I left the Allegheny College Men’s Tennis Team due to a lingering shoulder injury. After playing sports
my whole life, it felt strange not to be actively involved in a sport or hobby. To stay active, I decided to pursue a consistent gym
lifestyle, going five to six days a week. Thankfully, I already had some experience in the gym through teams and clubs, but without that foundation,
I would have had no idea where to start or how to define “success.” Through trial, learning from friends, and watching YouTube tutorials, I
gradually gained knowledge and confidence in the gym. That experience sparked the idea: what if there was an app that could track my progress
while providing personalized feedback to help me stay on track? I began experimenting with fitness apps like Whoop, Strong, Fitbod, and Hevy,
but none provided exactly what I was looking for. That gap inspired me to develop my own app, tailored to my fitness goals and workflow.
This process is especially unique because I am both the developer and a user of the app. Being able to experience the app firsthand allows me
to constantly evaluate features from a real-world perspective, ensuring usability, simple design, and functionality. This dual role enables me
to iterate quickly and create an application that is both practical and engaging for users like myself.

This process is especially unique as I am the developer for this app as well as someone who will be a user for this application. This unique
experience allows me to have a visual of what I want to create at all times of development. 

This background is why I feel particularly well-qualified for the developer role on this project. My academics at Allegheny College’s
CIS department have also provided me with a strong foundation in computer science, equipping me with the technical knowledge and problem-solving skills
needed to successfully design and implement a mobile application. Over the course of my studies, I have taken courses across nearly every
area of computer science, including software engineering, web design, computer security, and programming languages. This breadth of
exposure has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with multiple coding languages and frameworks, giving me the ability to approach the technical
challenges of app development.

Two courses, in particular, have shaped my ability to contribute effectively to this project: Software Engineering and Web Design. Software Engineering
provided me with experience in professional development workflows, including collaborative sprints, version control, and team-based problem solving.
I learned how to write code that is not only functional but also readable and maintainable by other team members, which is a critical skill for any large-scale project.
Understanding each function and code block in depth allows me to confidently iterate and expand the app while avoiding errors. Web design, meanwhile, highlighted
the importance of user interface and user experience. Developing a clean and visually appealing interface is crucial for engaging users, particularly
in a mobile app where ease of navigation and clarity are essential. The lessons from this course ensure that the app I am building is not only technically advanced
but also user-friendly.

Beyond my academic preparation, my personal experiences have shaped my motivation and insight into this project. As a lifelong athlete, I have spent countless
hours understanding training, fitness, and performance, which gave me firsthand knowledge of what users look for in a health and fitness app. Transitioning
from organized sports to independent gym training revealed a gap in available tools for tracking and improving personal fitness progress. By combining this
personal experience with my technical expertise, I can create an application that addresses real user needs.

Overall, my combination of technical training, practical experience, and personal motivation provides a strong foundation for this project. I am confident 
in my ability to develop an engaging and functional app that bridges the gap between software technology and health and wellness.

## Project Motivation

This project is driven by the goal of combining key areas of computer science, data analysis, and mobile system
integration to create a functional and efficient fitness technology solution. It provides practical experience in app
development, data integration, and skills that are valued in the modern technology industry. Through
the development of a mobile application that collects, processes, and evaluates the data, the project simulates
the type of real-world problem-solving encountered in software engineering and health technology fields. 

This project is also motivated by the integration and correlation of scientific and technical principles to advance
personal fitness through mobile app development. It applies core STEM disciplines of data evaluation, computer science,
and software engineering to design and implement an iOS application that automatically takes in user-inputted data
and provides concise feedback. 

Science and data represent one of the most direct connections between this project and STEM disciplines. The iOS
application collects user-inputted fitness data and performs automated analysis to interpret and present this
information meaningfully. The collected data is utilized in multiple ways, primarily for evaluating user performance
and progress over time. By processing the data into both structured logs and dynamic visualizations, the app enables
users to identify trends, track new personal records, and observe progression or regression across various metrics. Data
analysis plays a key role for both the user and the backend system. Users interact with visual representations such as
graphs to clearly view their performance history and identify patterns, while the backend continuously 
updates and organizes the dataset to support accurate and real-time insights.

Technology and engineering also play a heavy role in this project. The concept of building and developing a mobile
app with real-world functionality demonstrates the practical application of engineering principles in software design
and system development. The project involves using Apple's development ecosystem, including Swift, Xcode to create 
an efficient mobile app. Through these tools, the app integrates user interfaces, local data storage, and data analysis.
From an engineering standpoint the project requires consistent testing and debugging to ensure complete
functionality and accuracy. These processes mirror the real-world design cycle. This involves designing solutions, 
implementing systems, and refining them based on testing. By applying these principles within this current project, 
it reinforces the integration of technology and engineering.

This project contributes to the broader field of public health and fitness engagement by allowing users to take an
active role in understanding and improving their gym-self. Through user-inputted data-driven insights and personalized analytics,
the iOS application encourages consistent use and progress tracking, making health more accessible and
engaging. By visualizing performance trends and progress over time, users can make informed decisions about
their fitness routines and lifestyle habits. This approach promotes a stronger connection between personal data
awareness and long-term health outcomes. Data has shown that consistent exercise provides a variety of benefits that
include strengthening bones, positive effects on mood, and even helping to prevent chronic illnesses like diabetes and
heart disease (Ahmed). Knowing this, the ability to quickly and freely track progress is something that creates benefits, 
even outside of benching more wight than last month.

In addition to promoting user engagement, the project addresses critical considerations surrounding data privacy and
security. Seemingly, these days, data privacy and security are a growing topic. We are seeing more and more mobile devices
contracting online viruses from phishing emails or users clicking faulty links. But specifically regarding data
privacy, the importance of handling data leaks is emphasized.

The target audience for this project includes individuals who are seeking to learn more about their fitness habits and
gain experience with technology-assisted self-improvement before committing to more advanced or intensive programs. By
combining accessibility, automation, and educational value, the application serves as a bridge for users looking to
develop a deeper understanding of their health through technology. In 2024 alone, the number of data compromises in
the United States was 3,158, which is only 1% under the record number of compromises tracked within one calendar
year (Identity Theft Resource Center). This emphasizes the importance of local data storage for this project. All the data
that a user has within the application is directly stored on the user's mobile device. This significantly reduces exposure
to potential data breaches and ensures that sensitive information remains under the user's direct control. 

## Ethical Implications

Several ethical considerations that need to be acknowledged and talked about for this senior comprehensive project. A
few things that are important to talk about are data security, bugs and false user recommendations. Addressing these
concerns will provide context for the reasoning behind why I created what I did and how. 

First, it is important to acknowledge the user of personal data. This is an open mobile application that could receive a
large number of users; it is important to note the use of their data. As the developer of this application, I have no
access to the information that the users put into their profiles. This data is securely stored within their mobile
device and nowhere else. There is no possibility of data sharing within the app, which creates no possibility of a breach
of data. I acknowledge that other apps provide users with the ability to share data with friends or communities
within the app. While further researching this concept, I decided that it would be a better and safer solution to solely
keep the data for the user's use only. While there are benefits to communities and friends within an app like this to be
able to compare data with friends and communities, the idea of users' data being jeopardized is a much more serious
matter to be addressed. This concept plays into the idea of why I am developing my experiment in this specific fashion.

At first, I thought it would be much more beneficial to conduct an experiment utilizing colleagues to gather responses
based on their use of the app and how it helped them progress in the gym. While this experimental idea had its benefits,
it had many different ethical implications that had to be considered. I decided to avoid these implications by developing 
the idea of testing the app through AI-generated data. This experiment will provide me with all the information that I desire
in a way that does not conflict with any ethical considerations. This brings me to another thought: what if my evaluation could 
steer a user in the wrong direction?

As this application has an emphasis on feedback to the user to aid them in their gym journey, is it possible that a false
recommendation could have implications on their mindset? This is important to note and look further into. Once a user inputs
their data, they then receive certain feedback within the evaluation page depending on their data. This feedback may range
from letting the user know that they have exercised a muscle group too many times this week to you did twelve reps; maybe try 
upping the exercise weight to stick to a rep range of six to ten. As this experiment is provided to the user it may provide the user
with new knowledge that could change how they approach their workout. It is critical to know that the app is a tool
to supplement informed decision-making rather than a substitute for professional advice. By acknowledging the limitations
of data-driven models, the application promotes responsible use and encourages users to interpret their feedback as
well as combine it with personal judgments. 

Even with careful development and testing, the code may contain bugs or unexpected behaviors that could impact the user
experience or the accuracy of the data analysis. In the context of a fitness application, such bugs could lead to
incorrect feedback, misrepresented progress, or failure to update the user's personal records. For example, a calculation
error could suggest that a user has reached a personal record when they have not, or fail to warn them about overtraining
a muscle group. From an ethical perspective, acknowledging and mitigating the risks of bugs is essential. This includes
rigorous testing and providing mechanisms for users to report errors or inconsistencies. By planning for potential
software errors and maintaining transparency, the application prioritizes user trust, safety, and well-being.

As there are many ethical implications to consider within this application, I have developed this application in a specific
fashion to avoid many possible ethical issues. These include local storage of user data to ensure privacy, conducting
an experiment that handles AI-generated data instead of dealing with human data, acknowledging the fact that this app
may provide a false recommendation due to model limitations, and proactively testing the code to avoid the possibility
of bugs arising.

Finally, Chapter five discusses the results, highlights potential improvements, explores broader applications, and suggests 
directions for future research. This structure ensures a clear and logical presentation of the project from conception to evaluation
and implications.

## Contributions of The Project

This project contributes a custom iOS application that integrates workout tracking, data analysis, and personalized
feedback within a unified, simple, user-friendly mobile platform. Unlike other fitness applications, this system is
tailored to individual user-inputted data and emphasizes the interpretation of the data rather than just simple
data logging and visuals. This application includes six seperate pages that are key in acknowledging history, charts,
evaluation, awards, and the user profile view. 

This includes the development of a local user login and account creation system and an entirely device-based data storage model 
built in Swift. This creation demonstrates the importance of local data storage within my application. As discussed before,
preventing data leaks is the #1 reason behind the local storage.

The main landing page, once the user has logged in, is the history or workout log page. This page contains
all the specific exercises the user has completed. Once a user inputs their data for an exercise, including weight,
repetitions, and muscle group, this data will show up within the history page along with a date. The workout log
is an essential piece of content to include when creating a fitness app, as it allows users to rewind in time
to see their past data. Keeping this page simple is also important because as this page gets more complicated,
it may complicate the user's ability to easily view past workouts. 

Once new data is added to the History page, it is automatically reflected in the Charts page. The Charts page
continuously monitors for newly recorded data points and updates the corresponding exercise-specific graph whenever
a new entry is detected. Each graph visually represents trends over time, allowing users to clearly observe their
progression in the gym. These visualizations not only make performance trends easier to interpret but also help users
review their previous workouts to determine appropriate starting points for future sessions.

After that, the evaluation page also updates. This will give the user simple and concise feedback to aid them.
This will provide them with timely insights into whether they are progressing or regressing, it will provide them
with feedback on their training routine, recommending whether they should train a certain muscle group more or less. The importance
of short and concise feedback is emphasized as I do not want to overload the user with information. 

This then brings us to the awards page. This page is meant to bring gamification to life on my mobile app. The goal
of this page is to give the user a reason to keep being consistent and coming back to using this app. A majority of
the fitness apps contain some type of gamification as it is a way for users to stay engaged. An example of an
award would look like entering a workout for 100 days; an award like this gives users incentive to keep going to the gym
and bettering themselves each day.

Finally, this includes the profile page. This is a very simple page including a few key details, including personal
records, along with how many workouts the user has inputted. This was a way to let the user know their personal record
totals, meaning the total weight of the squat, deadlift, and bench press combined. This is a piece of information
that lots of gymgoers like to know as it gives the user another incentive to keep training hard.

These components form the core of my application and reflect months of learning, experimentation, and iteration. I
began studying app development—including the Xcode environment and the Swift programming language—in January 2024.
Since Swift was a new language for me, I wanted to build a strong foundation in its functions, structures, and syntax
before fully committing to development. I approached this by comparing Swift to languages I was already confident in,
such as Python, Java, and C. This comparative learning strategy helped me see how the concepts I had mastered in previous
coursework translated into Swift, ultimately giving me a more complete and intuitive understanding of iOS development.
This learning process also deepened my understanding of development methodology. Most importantly, it taught me the value
of continuous testing and troubleshooting—principles that cannot be emphasized enough. Early in development, I also
learned the importance of feasibility testing. This involves prototyping and evaluating an idea before fully implementing
it. A concept may seem perfectly reasonable when discussed in theory, but its feasibility often becomes much clearer once
development begins. Some ideas that sound simple in conversation can become significantly more complex when put into practice.
It is crucial to understand what can realistically be built. Once a developer commits to delivering a feature, users expect
that promise to be fulfilled. Because of this, knowing the limits, challenges, and feasibility of an idea before promising it 
is an essential part of responsible development. By integrating feasibility testing early and often, I was able to refine my ideas, 
avoid unnecessary roadblocks, and move forward with confidence in the parts of the application I chose to implement. This
leads to the importance of a thorough experiment.

For my experiment, I plan to utilize AI-generated data. The goal of this experiment is to conduct a thorough experiment
that aims to evaluate each part of my application. By doing this, I will gain important knowledge and information that can
provide necessary feedback to aid the final developmental sprint.

For this experiment, I will utilize AI-generated data to simulate realistic user interactions and workout patterns
within the application. Using AI-generated inputs allows me to test the system under controlled, repeatable conditions
without relying on human data at this stage of development. This approach ensures that I can evaluate each feature of
the app—including data processing, visualizations, and system responsiveness—using consistent and diverse datasets.
AI-generated data also enables me to stress test the application and identify potential issues early. By incorporating 
this method, I can gather meaningful insights and feedback that will directly inform and improve the final development 
sprint. While AI-generated data is highly useful for early-stage testing, it is important to acknowledge both
its strengths and its limitations. AI data provides clean, structured inputs that allow for controlled experimentation, 
making it ideal for identifying technical issues, validating core functionality, and ensuring the app behaves as expected across
a wide range of scenarios, in this case across different mobile devices. However, AI-generated data cannot perfectly replicate the 
unpredictability and variability of real human behavior. Because of this, the results of AI-based testing must be 
viewed as preliminary. Even with these limitations, AI-generated data remains a powerful tool that enables efficient, 
iterative testing and helps streamline the development process.

This experiment aims to provide me with feedback on graph compression, responsiveness, data processing, and query
times. As visuals are a key component of this application, the importance that they are clean and legible cannot be
emphasized enough. Some research questions that this aims to answer are as follows: How will the graphs look with one
year's worth of user data? How will the graphs compress? Will the data points be too close together? These are all
essential to the success of my application. Without knowing the answers to all these questions, the app would feel
incomplete. Moving forward with this concept involves gaining knowledge of responsiveness. This theme is of number one importance
within app development. Developers pride themselves on giving a fun and engaging user experience. If the app takes ten
seconds to load a specific page, users will most likely find a different application. Learning about the amount of 
data it takes to slow down the app or if it even slows down at all is an essential question. Providing this application
with years' worth of data will answer this question. Checking and examining the responsiveness of moving between pages, 
loading the application, and touch responsiveness will all be of utmost importance to answer. Query times are very similar
to this theme. Within the application, there are many different search queries, like personal records, for loops actively looking
for a specific experiment, and many more. How will these be affected when they have to look through 1000 or 5000 data points?
Being able to provide evidence that this app can run these queries without the time being affected will be a very strong
argument and point for my application. 

This experiment, in conclusion, is well developed and aims to conduct a study in place for a human study. This
AI-generated data allows me to experiment in a controlled environment where the defined variables are a strong point 
of this experiment.
