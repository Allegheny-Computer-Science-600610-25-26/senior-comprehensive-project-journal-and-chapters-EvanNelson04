# Introduction

## 1.1 - Background

This Senior Comprehensive Project aims to address the problem within the fitness domain. Specifically, 
the lack of accessible, personalized feedback in gym training. Millions of people visit gyms each day
with the goal of improving their health and performance, yet many struggle to determine whether they are
training effectively. Questions such as “Am I using the right form?”, “How much weight should I lift?”
, or “Is my progress on track?” often go unanswered without a personal trainer or advanced tracking
tools. To bridge this gap, my iOS application provides real-time, user input data-driven feedback 
designed to guide.

The gym lifestyle has been actively growing for over 20 years. In 2000, around 32.8 million people had
active gym memberships in the United States. Since then, that number has more than doubled to approximately
77 million in 2024, with predictions estimating 85–90 million memberships by 2030 (Kerxhaliu). As the
number of gym-goers continues to rise, so does the portion of this population seeking feedback—whether
through phone applications, personal trainers, or wearables. Currently, about 29% of gym-goers work
with personal trainers (Kerxhaliu). However, the average hourly rate for a professional personal
trainer ranges from $40 to $70 (Niepytalska), which can significantly increase the cost of
maintaining a fitness routine. What if there were a way to provide this guidance in a simple,
free iOS app on your phone?

In this day and age everyove carries their phone every where they go, to work, to dinner, to their kids
soccer game and to the gym. So taking advantage of this and creating all this feedbadck that can be
at the palm of their hands in an app on their phone. In 2024, fitness apps were downloaded a total
of 850 million times and out of that 345 million people actively utilized those fitness apps (Curry).
